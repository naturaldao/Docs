## Introduction

Hierarchically DAism has three parts:

* DAism Framework
* DAism Store
* DAOs

DAism is a platform which consists of a framework (DAism Framework), a dApp store (DAism Store) and DAOs any one can create.

The DAism Store is a dApp market similar to Google Play. That is to say any person or Organism can permissionlessly use the dApps to contruct a DAO.
