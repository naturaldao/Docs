## Introduction

Hierarchically DAism has three parts:

* DAism Framework
* DAism Bazaar
* DAOs

DAism is a platform which consists of a framework (DAism Framework), an open module store (DAism Store) and DAOs any one can create.

The DAism Store is an open-source application market similar to Google Play. That is to say any person or Organism can permissionlessly use the modules to contruct a DAO.
