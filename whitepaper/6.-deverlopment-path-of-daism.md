# 6. Deverlopment Path of DAism

## The Mission of DAism

After a decade of exploration, blockchain, through the hardcore developments of tokens and smart contracts, has demonstrated the tremendous power of fundamental values such as decentralization, anti-censorship, trustlessness, permissionlessness, anonymity, and more. The proof-of-work in Bitcoin and the current proof-of-stake in Ethereum are the most successful governance mechanisms aligning with these fundamental values. However, these achievements have primarily been at the public chain layer rather than the decentralized application layer. We recognize the urgent need for effective governance in the development of dApps and a reasonable governance solution for decentralized swap markets. Now, DAism's governance consensus, "Proof of Value" (PoV), will complete the construction of Good tokenomics and provide a solid governance foundation for the flourishing of dApps' deverlopment!

## Deverlopment of DAism

DAism is initiated and deverloped by NaturalDAO. DAism is a public platform that follows the SC0 protocol and the develop is entirely in an open manner.
