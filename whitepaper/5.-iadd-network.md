# 5. IADD Network

## Overview

Missions:

* Automatically deploying a decentralized exchange
* Automatically deploying a decentralized payment network.

The IADD network is a perfect combination of them.



"Natrural DAO" is a philosophical thought from the Tao Te Ching, meaning that the law reflected in everything is "Mother Natural". IADD is runing based on decentralized rules.

&#x20;To build a functioning decentralized world driven by blockchain it is critical to establish various "rules" and "laws", which the most important ones are smart contract standards

After the outbreak of ICO, we quickly discovered that there were various problems. One of the problems is the lack of a uni-exchange based on decentralized blockchain technology.

Currently there are three popular ways to list and trade a token.

*   Listing and trading a token in a centralized exchange e.g. Binance.

    This is a traditional way which is both centralized and the least cost-effective. A token issuer has to pay huge commissions including a "listing fee", "service fee", "token price bolstering fee" etc to an exchange.

    Quite often this hurts a token issuer's interests and hurts investors' interests as well, which we all witnessed in 2018's market crash.
*   Listing and trading a token in Bancor

    Although Bancor doesn't charge a trading fee, means it still charges a token issuer a listing fee. A token issuer has to buy equivalent BNT as a reserve to build a trading pair with its token. This is an alternative listing fee a token issuer pays as a pledge, and as long as the token issuer wants to trade its token in Bancor this pledge can never be revoked. In addition the trading price of a token paired with BNT suffers from BNT's price volatility.
*   Listing and trading a token with Uniswap exchange protocol

    This way a token issuer no longer relies on a single entity to provide liquidity. But in this case people who provide liquidity (trading pairs) may lose money therefore active trading of a token needs willing people to provide liquidity. Without those people a token issuer has to jump in and provide liquidity to bolster trading. This would result in possible collusion between a token issuer and liquidity providers or manipulation of market by liquidity providers, and they might gradually, naturally and eventually be in cahoots with each other.

DAism's solution:

* According to DAism's Circulation Token Protocol, all tokens of every DAO initially supply the IADD network.
* Like Uniswap we use a similar but improved CPMM algorithm to determine a real-time decentralized trading price for any EIP-3712 token that is listed and traded in IADD network. Unlike Uniswap or Bancor we use exactly the same volume of issued token as the base, and we don't use ETH or BNT, whose prices in USD fluctuate hugely, to form a trading pair but use a Unit Token(uToken) instead.&#x20;

DAism's solution doesn't need any party especially a token issuer to spend money and resources to bolster trading, while bearing a huge risk of losing money. In our solution right after the very first token's issue completes (by the plateform DAism), this token will be automatically listed on IADD Network. You can then buy or sell the token in IADD. IADD is both a Uni-exchange and a Uni-payment Network.

The Unit Token, uToken, is issued by IADD utilizing a decentralized and decensored mechanism. uToken's base price is defined as vita. Therefore adoption of uToken has big potentials to turn blockchain technologies into real popular applications.&#x20;

## Acronyms

**DEX**

Decentralized Exchange.

**Improved CPMM**

Constant Product Market Maker is a model of market maker and generates token pricing in a non-linear way. CPMM is used by Uniswap, and we have imporved it.

**ISC**

IADD Smart Contract. It is a set of smart contracts which work similar to Bancor and establish a decentralized exchange protocol for ERC20 tokens.

**IEP**

IADD Exchange Protocol. It is a decentralized exchange protocol.

**Unit Token, uToken**

It is a Unit Token issued by ISC.

**IADD Network(Instantly and Automatically Deployed DeSwap Network)**

A decentralized swap network that is instantly and automatically deployed.&#x20;

## Main Protocols shaping IADD network

1. Unit Token Protocol\
   See below.
2. Circulation Token Protocol(Protocol of Token's Circulating Supply)\
   见“道易程协议”部分。
3. Dex Protocol\
   After all the tokens are issued to the IADD network, they become reserve coins. The reserve token realizes value discovery through automatic calculation and provides liquidity for the market, regardless of the size of the transaction.\
   This is a revolutionary agreement, because the decentralized trading network built on it does not require and does not allow anyone to participate in liquidity!
4. Decentralized Payments Protocol\
   This protocol closely cooperates with Circulation Token Protocol and Decentralized Autonomous Fund Protocol.\
   The key point of this protocol is to provide a payment interface: If a DAO's token is A, when it sells products or services, no matter which token the consumer uses to pay, the DAO will get A. Yes, if consumers use any of other tokens to pay, there is an automatically convert triggered through the IADD network and the DAO will be paid by A. If a DAO does not issue a token, no matter which token the consumer uses to pay, the DAO will receive uToken. The mechanism is similar to the first case.&#x20;

## Unit Token Protocol

In this protocol, the pricing standard is uToken, and the basic price unit is vita, which means that the price of a uToken is defined as 1 vita. uToken's precision is 18 bits. The issuance mechanism of uToken is named as **ETH Forge.**

Name: Unit Token

Abbr: uToken

Symbol: uTOKEN

Basic Unit: vita

1 vita = 100 cent

### Mechanism of ETH FORGING

This section requires you to understand Uniswap's constant product formula(automated market maker algorithm) in advance. Please refer to the following information for details.

Hayden Adams. 2018：[https://hackmd.io/@477aQ9OrQTCbVR3fq1Qzxg/HJ9jLsfTz?type=view.](https://hackmd.io/@477aQ9OrQTCbVR3fq1Qzxg/HJ9jLsfTz?type=view.)

And the discussion initiated by vitalik Buterin: [Improving front running resistance of x\*y=k market makers](https://ethresear.ch/t/improving-front-running-resistance-of-x-y-k-market-makers/1281)

Issued by an ETH FORGING model, uToken will temporarily be 1:1 pegged with the US dollar. Its demicals are 18. uToken's issurance mechanism is as follows:

We introduce a Reverse Improved CPMM algorithm to initialize the system with ETH's circulating supply, and market cap.

1. We introduce a Reverse Imporved Constant Product (RICP) algorithm to initialize the system with ETH's circulating supply, market cap and uToken's defined price unit (1 vita).
2.  After an ETH supply and an uToken supply are obtained the product of the two crypto supplies can be composed.

    On system initialization, and ETH's real-time market cap will be used as the system's initial uToken supply.
3. RICP Algorithm（Reverse Improved Constant Product Algorithm）

## IADD：即刻自动部署的去中心化兑换网络 Instantly and Automatically Deployed DeSwap

1. 真实映射市场需求：创建DAO时将同时根据流通通证发行协议发行其代币，并全部发行到 IADD 网络。

Trading Market That Reflects Real Demand:

班科和Uniswap的第一个普遍问题，就是储备库里质押的币太少！这会导致很小的交易即可造成币价的波动太大，等于币价的波动自带了一个杠杆，失去市场定价的合理性。100%意味着我们映射出所有发行到用户手中的通证，接下来因供需造成的币价变化，才是完全没有杠杆的真实的变化。

A common issue that both Bancor and Uniswap face is that there are insufficient tokens in their reserves. This leverages price vibration and results in relatively large price fluctuations when trading volumes go slightly higher. Our solution injects an ICO's full token amount into the decentralized exchange and reflects the market's real demand. Only based on this liquidity will a token's pricing be rational and reasonable.

&#x20;

1. 这个规则有如下积极作用：This mechanism has the following advantages:

*
  * 代币全部发行到 IADD 网络中，项目方一个币没有，因此 IADD Network 让项目方无法通过虚假项目，用预留在自己手中的代币（有时候高达百分之八九十），在交易网络马上抛售获利。Every DAO's token is issued diretly to IADD newtwork, initially there is no Token allocate to the DAO. Thus the IADD Network prevents a token issuer from dumping his tokens for uTokens. There are cases in which a token issuer issues a worthless token and dumps his holding (maybe up to 80 or 90 percent of the total token supply) for valuable tokens such as ETH and stable coins etc right after his token is listed for trading.
  * 早期投资者将只能像传统企业融资一样，通过DAO的去中心化自治基金会的契约（如期发行的债券），参与早期融资。再也无人能与项目方狼狈为奸，在通证一上交易所，就全部抛售，等币价暴跌之后，再低价买入。这就要求投资者在投资一个项目时，要做好项目尽调，审慎投资。There are cases in which right after a token is listed for trading some investors collude with the token issuer to firstly beat down the token price by dumping their holdings and then buy back at a price even lower than the ICO price. The IADD Network prevents this from happening. For instance in this system after token ABC is listed for trading if no one buys ABCs none of the existing ABC holders can sell their ABCs, because there's no uToken on the trade pair, it only exists in the Improved CPMM (only a number for the algorithm). This drives all investors to investigate deeply an ICO project before he makes an investment decision.
  * 以上两项，实际上为代币发行提供了基础监管机制。The above points can be viewed as a result of regulations to token's issue.
  * 在项目早期阶段，对从交易市场参与的投资者有一定的保护作用。因为币价无法跌破ICO发行价，不会开盘就出现币价无理暴跌90%甚至95%的惨况。This mechanism prevents a token's price from dropping below its ICO price therefore protects investors, who bought the token on IADD, from suffering huge losses due to price diving which often happens in all existed exchanges and could cause a token's price to lose 90% to 95% percent after that token is listed for trading.
  * 为项目提供了自然死亡机制——无论是中心化交易所，还是班科、Uniswap等去中心化交易所，币价都是可以无限下跌的，没有一个明确的信号提醒后续的投资者一个项目可能或者已经成为僵尸！在IADD Network里，币价跌倒发行价，则意味着该项目已经完全被市场抛弃。这相当于给区块链市场的其他未介入的投资者一个红色警报，告诫他们不要轻易买入这一通证。如果一个项目的通证常年滞留在发行价，那么就能告诫投资者，它极可能已经失败！Signals an alarm for a dying token--- In a traditional crypto exchange or decentralized exchange such as Bancor and Uniswap etc a token's price can go down infinitely. It is hard to judge whether or not a token/project's development is still on track. In the IADD Network when a token's price goes down to its initial price, nobody holders it. It might mean this DAO is totally discarded by the market. This signals an alarm that this token/project may have problems. If a token's price remains at the ICO price for a long time, e.g. 1 year or even longer, this signals an alarm that this token/project may fail.
  * 此时，项目方还是可以在出售自己的产品或服务时，只要事实证明产品或服务靠谱，就能慢慢让自己的项目起死回生。There are cases in which a token/project's development is not recognized by the markets and its price is beaten down to its ICO price but its team is striving to revamp its development. In this case although the token's price is too low for its holders to sell it, its team may still have chances to save the project by delivering good service and product. Once its service and product are recognized by the markets again the token's price will go up again.

&#x20;

## DAism的IADD Network使用协议 DAism Protocol for Use IADD Network

1. DAism由NaturalDAO管理。 IADD is a DAO, and the fund is managed by NaturalDAO's DAF.
2. 要使用IADD，项目方必须接受道易程的代币发行协议、去中心化自治基金会协议、去中心化支付协议。但 IADD 并不审核项目的动机和质量等等。The IADD is permissionless, this means it's totally free to be used, it doesn't judge its purpose or quality etc.
3. IADD让用户可以接受用任何本网络内的通证代替ETH，参与投资、交易和支付。
4. 项目方必须自愿放弃自己的通证的所有权。并无权要求NaturalDAO撤出交易对里自己的通证。After an token's issue succeeds, this kind of token's ownership will be released from the token issuer and this re-issurance cannot be reverted.
5. 如因黑客原因，ISC合约地址的所有或部分通证被盗，DAism有责任提供证据，进行补救，但因为涉及社区共识等问题，DAism项目方并不承担任何理赔或者保证完全恢复正常的责任。If DAism is attacked and the tokens in this exchange are stolen, DAism can provide transaction records as evidence but will not be responsible for compensation or guarantee the attacked system will be back to work.
6. DAism如果失败，不承担任何连带的赔偿责任。If DAism has issues or fails it is not responsible for any compensation.
7. DAism不承担因以太坊或者其它网络或者受攻击被破坏等原因，给第三方通证的部署带来的延迟，或者给第三方带来的任何损失的赔偿责任。DAism is deployed and runs on Ethereum. DAism will not be responsible for any aftermath should an attack on Ethereum cause DAism out of order or loss of tokens that are traded in it.

## IADD的优点：Advantages of IADD

1. 即刻部署Instant Deployment

ICO一结束，项目方发行的通证即可开始和定价通证或者其它任何已经发行的ERC20通证交易。Right after an ICO succeeds its token will be listed and traded with the stable coin uToken or any ERC20 tokens that are available for trading in IADD network.

&#x20;

1. 全自动部署Automatical Deployment

智能合约自动部署交易所。A token's listing and trading are managed and automatically deployed by smart contracts.

&#x20;

1. 实现了交易和支付的无人值守\
   现有的所有去中心化交易所都是需要人值守才能运作的。IADD的创新意义重大！\

2. 消灭了中心化市场部署带来的特权 Eliminates possible privileges multiple parties have in Centralized Exchange

褫夺了项目方、中心化交易所和庄家对市场的操控特权。除了自由交易，交易所完全卸去了人类的一切权力干扰。In a typical centralized exchange a token issuer, the exchange and possible bankers may collude with one another to manipulate the token's price.Our proposal elimiates these parties' privileges and possible collusion, and dismantles human interference in trading.

&#x20;

1. 第一次给区块链市场带来了币价计算的可靠基准

First Ever Decentralized Model for Token Pricing with Stable Coin

BNT和ETH本身相对于法币的价格，它们的波动性非常大，因此能够给班科或者Uniswap构建的交易所里面的通证的价格雪上加霜或者火上浇油，亦即即使一个项目本身的发展已经平稳了，但其通证的市场价格永远无法平稳。不稳定的币价造成投机气氛日益蔓延，通证无法被用户稳定持有而最终使得项目无法落地应用！

Trading of a token in Bancor or Uniswap is paired with BNT or ETH. In either case when BNT or ETH's price fluctuates hugely a token paired with it is affected by the price fluctuation as well. For example when a project's development is well on track ideally its token would in general be traded at a stable price in fiat currency. But when the token's trading is paired with BNT or ETH its price in fiat currency might fluctuate as BNT or ETH's price in fiat currency fluctuates. This price volatility would fuel speculation rather than encourage application in business and economy.

&#x20;

1. 给区块链带来了可落地应用的解决方案

Brings Applicable Stable Coin to Blockchain Based Applications

我们知道只有定价通证才是应用到零售市场（譬如电商市场）的最佳币种。 IADD为区块链的支付提供了最关键的两个环节，亦即价格绝对不变的定价通证，以及去中心化兑换网络。

The best and most popular application of a stable coin is in retail (e.g. e-business), micro payment and etc. IADD provides the most critical part of the payment for the blockchain, that is, stable coin uToken with absolutely solid price.

&#x20;

1. 最合理的价格发现机制 Rational Pricing Model

Bancor和Uniswap交易对里质押的通证，都是有主的可流通资产。即使其数量达到其通证总量的5%（班科建议的质押量的最大值），其交易对的价格波动敏感度，是其总量价格敏感度的20倍（计算所得，待补充计算过程）。

In Bancor the base token is BNT and in Uniswap the base token is ETH. Both BNT and ETH belong to stakeholders or token issuer. In Bancor the real maximum reserve a token issuer can provide is about 5%(Bancor's recommended value) of the total supply. Even with the maximum reserve a token's price volatility is still huge. This volatility is nearly 20 times the volatity which trading with a token's total supply would generate(More details will be added for this later).

&#x20;

IADD交易对里的通证的总量与储备库（Liquidity）外所有用户持有的通证总量一致，因此它的价格涨跌没有任何杠杆效应，能够真实反应一笔交易对其通证带来的价格变化！这无疑是最真实的价格发现机制。

In our proposal when a token's ICO succeeds the equivalent amount of the token issued for the ICO will be issued and transferred to the exchange. Those additionally issued tokens and don't belong to any stakeholders or token issuer and cannot be taken out from the exchange without trading. Therefore pricing of a token in the exchange reflects real trading's demand and supply. This pricing model is rational and reasonable

&#x20;

1. 项目方零成本，非常容易得到项目方的支持 Zero Cost for Token Listing, Token Issuer Loves It

本项目为项目方带来了极大的便利，去除了项目方构建其通证的交易市场时产生的巨额成本，去除了外界对于项目方在构建交易市场时可能产生的一切不良猜忌。对于本项目，各区块链项目方应该是非常欢迎的。

Our proposal brings great interests to a token issuer by eliminating the aforementioned huge costs and building confidence in both the token project and the token issuer. Token issuers would love this proposal.

&#x20;

1. 除了应用于投资市场，还使得区块链支付可以落地应用。因uToken价格绝对恒定，产品和服务的定价和消费支付，就有了一个坚实可靠的基础。

&#x20;

1. 完全符合区块链的核心价值观

Adhering To Blockchain's Core Values

完全符合区块链的去中心化、去审核的核心原则。

Our proposal is completely decentralized and censorship-resistant.

&#x20;

1. 探索区块链dAPP规则的优化方法，譬如在去中心化前提下，为dAPP的自然淘汰建立规则。

It might a mechanism to phase out failed dAPPs.
