# 3. The Composition of PoV

The Proof of Value in DAism is interwoven with three parts:

1. Seven governance protocols:\
   DAO Hardcore Protocol\
   Decentralized Minting Protocol\
   Protocol of DAFï¼ŒProtocol of Decentralized Autonomous Fundation\
   Protocol of Valuation Token's Supply\
   Protocol of Unit Token\
   Protocol of Decentralized Exchange\
   Protocol of Universal Payment
2. One governance network:\
   IADD Network, which is composed of multiple governance protocols, providing universal and indispensable transaction and settlement functionalities for all DAOs.\
   IADD Network inherits the decentralized market mechanism from Bancor Network, a groundbreaking innovation. Coupled with innovations in measuring token units, token issuance, market supply mechanisms, and more, DAism fundamentally disrupts the underlying logic of the existing decentralized exchanges(DEXs). This involves challenging the age-old economic principles of the human world, creating unique market economic principles specific to blockchain, and, based on this foundation, overturning the traditional economic value theories to create blockchain economic value theories and implement decentralized methods.
3. Two governance foundations:\

   A 2% transaction fee on each token exchange serves as a bonus for the DAO to which the valuation token belongs.\
