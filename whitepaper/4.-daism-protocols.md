# 4. DAism Protocols

DAism's framework relies on basic protocols which are the basic building blocks of the whole ecosystem. Some will be Ethereum's standards such as EIP-2569 submitted two years ago, in which we proposed a means to save images directly on Ethereum, and recently submitted EIP-3712 in which we proposed a multi fungible token standard.

&#x20;Here are the main protocols DAism's framework has:

* Core DAO Protocol (a Decentralized Smart Organism Core Protocol)
* Unit Token Protocol
* Decentralized Autonomous Fund Protocol
* Circulation Token Protocol
* Token of Honor Protocol
* Reputation Token Protocol
* Dex Protocol
* DAism Payment Protocol

## **Core DAO Protocol**

* The Core DAO Protocol defines the basic information for a DAO such as the Organism's ID, name in English, logo image(in SVG format, recommended file size less than 6k), description(it can be a slogan), date of establishment, team members(in ETH address, anonymous), address of smart contract that manages decentralized autonomous fund and etc.
* It provides decentralized authentication services for products and services for all DAOs registered with it.
* The Core DAO Protocol is scalable.

Does a DAO have entry permission?

In our belief every DAO should have no entry permission at all. Everything about it is open and permissionlessly accessible. Its management and decision-making processes are based on transparent rules and intelligent algorithms.

To sum up, with regard to entry permission DAism's framework should be:

* fully open and permissionless, or
* if a DAO intends to evaluate a potential member's qualification it needs to utilize third party developed "doorkeeper" modules to do it

With regard to the details, here are the key factors:

1. Without an initial consensus, no one has initiatives or rights, therefore no DAOs can be constructed. Our strategy by default is to set a DAO's creator as its founder or authorizer. A creator defines a DAO's basic details (such as modules, configurations, issuance details of its circulation token and etc). Note: when created, all available modules not just core modules will be listed and members can permissionlessly select any modules to create a DAO.
2. To create a DAO on DAism one needs to set its project's name, issue ERC-20 tokens, set up reputation tokens, authenticate honor tokens, deploy decentralized exchanges and DPayment systems etc.
3. When setting up a DAO, its creator(s) can input some addresses as cofounders. (The number of ETH accounts should be no more than 100 for now.) Each of these accounts could be given an honor token titled "Cofounder". These honor tokens can be designed and issued by a third party or by default by the system itself.
4. The implementation details of decision-making processes based on decentralized consensus are handled in the layer of applications.
5. By default a DAO's rules and settings should be completely transparent.
6. After a DAO is successfully created it will automatically receive a decentralized authenticated token. You can refer to **Decentralized Authentication and Management of DHonor** for more details about the design and implementation of such a token&#x20;

## **Decentralized Authentication Procotol**

DAism provides decentralized authentication services for individuals, DAOs and Dapps. The decentralized authentication process for a DAO is pretty straightforward. When a DAO is created on DAism, it will have a unique name and will be allocated with a contract address for its decentralized autonomous fund(DAF). This contract address is globally unique. Its name and this contract address for its DAF together will be this DAO's authentication tag which ensures this DAO's authenticity. The format of this authentication tag is :

Ⓓ DHonor0xFC2C722b8fe7B3Ca277D349Cbad6D2c5ce2eCF9C

i.e. Authentication Symbol + DAO's Name + DAF's Contract Address

All the tokens (including both fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens) issued or services provided by a DAO will have such an authentication tag.

The decentralized authentication of a DAO is a proof of the DAO's current state and can prove the authenticity of the states and information of the DAO, its issued tokens and products (such as DApps).

The decentralized authentication of a DApp proves the authenticity of the DApp's information and furthermore provides interfaces for DAism to call its services. After a DApp is authenticated by DAism (i.e. with successful registration), any DAO registered with DAism can search for and call the DApp's interfaces and services via DAism Bazaar.

You can refer to **DAism Decentralized Authentication and Management** for more details about the design, implementation and application of decentralized authentication.

## **Circulation Token Protocol**

Any DAO can issue its circulation token (i.e. ERC-20 token). This token is facilitated to grow its economic ecosystem and pave the way for the DAO's long term development.

This procotol defines a token's name, symbol, logo, supply, price and issurance mechanism.

The circulation token procotol is one of the key protocols of the IADD network. Every DAO that issues a circulation token should follow the rules below:

* All the supply should be sent to the IADD network. The DAO that issues its token has no reserves. This is a specially designed rule that prevents the DAO from colluding with "whales" to manipulate the market.
* A circulation token's total supply is 10,000,000,000 and the initial price is 0.01 vita
* For every transaction of a circulation token, a transaction fee (0.195%) is charged
* This procotol interacts with IADD's payment protocol. For instance, a DAO has issued its circulation token and sells its products or services in the circulation token (the unit is vita). Customers who buy the DAO's products or services can pay whatever tokens but the paid tokens will be converted by the IADD network to the circulation token and sent to the DAO's DAF address. If a DAO doesn't issue its circulation token, it can only sell its products or services in uToken.

## **Decentralized Autonomous Fund Management Protocol**

Every DAO needs a Sustainable Decentralized Autonomous Fund (abbreviated as "SDAF"). DAism provides functions and services for such an SDAF.

* DAism provides smart contracts to manage a decentralized autonomous fund.
* Any SDAF including funds raised from an ICRO(Initial Coin and Reputation Offerings), payments or investment to its DAO is managed by the smart contracts.
* This protocol interacts with IADD's payment protocol: if a DAO has issued its circulation token, its DAF will only accept its circulation token.
* If a DAO has issued its circulation token and sells its products or services in the circulation token (the unit is vita), when customers buy the DAO's products or services they can pay whatever tokens but the paid tokens will be converted by the IADD network to the circulation token and sent to the DAO's DAF address. If a DAO doesn't issue its circulation token, it can only sell its products or services in uToken.
* Earnings made by a DAO are directly sent to its DAF address. This ensures a DAO's long term development and a sustainable DAF.
* The transaction fees set by the circulation token protocol and the interaction between the circulation token protocol and IADD's payment protocol are also rules of this protocol.
* Besides fund management, this procotol provides three basic utilities: a database of vote weights, a voting machine and a vote inspector. Users can extend the functions and features of these three utilities by using their own tools or third-parties' templates or dApps
* A whitelist, a blacklist or both are optional to ensure DAF's safety and security.

## **Reputation Protocol**

This is an optional protocol. This protocol is one of the most important components of a DAO's decision-making mechanism and one of the most important protocols of a reputation system (others include circulation tokens and tokens of honor). It is also a quantitative metric that works with tokens of honor to evaluate the contribution of a member to a DAO.

Tokens of honor are used as

* PoW: member's proof of work, and
* PoS: member's proof of staking. For instance, if Alice's reputation value is twice as much as Bob's, one Alice's vote will weigh twice as much as that of one Bob's vote.

Adoption of reputation in DAOs will lead to integration of blockchain's consensus in DAOs.

For any member of a DAO his/her reputation is his/her proof of work. Therefore in a DAO a member's reputation is an incentive to the member's contribution just like mining to a miner in Bitcoin. For instance, two members A and B both belong to a DAO. If member A's contribution is twice as much as that of member B's, member A's reputation value will be twice as much as that of member B's. A member's reputation value is also the member's stake in a DAO, which means for instance, if member A's reputation value is twice as much as that of member B's, member A's voting weight will be twice as much as that of member B's.

Reputation is likely applied this way: any member with a certain reputation value can submit a proposal for any issue such as applying for financial support for a task. If this proposal is passed by qualified members, an amount of fund in the decentralized autonomous fund (abbreviated as "DAF") will be reserved for that member . However in this stage the fund is only reserved for the member. Only after the member accomplishes the task and the final result passes a audit, will the fund be sent to the member. Essentially, a DAO's fund is completely managed by collective decison-making processes rather than by a group of privileged people(most likely founders or co-founders of that DAO).

Here is how fund is granted from DAF:

Submit a proposal -> Evaluate the proposal -> Reserve fund (if the proposal passed) -> Accomplish a task -> Evaluate the result -> Send fund (if the result passes an audit)

Features of token of honor:

1 it is a non-transferrable fungible token. This prevents collusion among multiple members.

2 Each DAO has its own reputation.

3 A DAO's decentralized foundation (DF) makes rules and decisions. And these rules and decisions are coded in smart contracts and executed by smart contracts when predefined conditions are triggered. For instance, smart contracts can increase or decrease the reputation value owned by an ETH address or can blacklist an ETH address. Another instance might be that when a DAO pays its circulation tokens to an address, that address will be rewarded with a certain amount of tokens of honor as well.

4 A DAO's decentralized foundation (DF) can inherit the reputation value and rules of anther DAO's DF. For instance, if an ETH address is a member of multiple DAOs, when this address votes for a proposal in a DAO, its reputation value will be accounted as the sum of all the reputation values that it holds in all the multiple DAOs in which it is a member.

5 An ETH address can reject an increase offered to its reputation value or freeze its reputation value. The former may mean that this address is willing to offer the increase in reputation value to the reputation value of another ETH address temporarily. The latter may mean this address gives up its voting power.

## **Unit Token Protocol**

The unit token(Abbreviated as uToken) is a native crypto generated by a constant product formula employed in the IADD network(a network consisting of a DEX and a DPayment system). It is used to denominate the price of every token or crypto asset such as ETH, ERC-20 tokens etc in the ecosystem.

1. uToken 是一种非常独特的代币。它是道易程定义的一种价格标准物（定价通证），被定义为 1 uToken = 1 vita。和我们熟知的质量单位类似，道易程有一套价格单位用于计算流通通证（代币）的价格。其中vita是代币的基本价格单位。\
   The Unit Token, uToken, is the monetary unit token facilitated in DAism. 1 uToken = 1 vita. Like the existing unit systems such as mass, length etc, DAism has a monetary unit system and vita is the smallest unit.
2. 道易程平台里面的一切代币（流通通证）的即时价格，都以定价通证 uToken 为标准物，以 vita为计价单位，通过恒定乘积算法（constant product formula）计算获取。\
   In DAism every token is traded based on a constant product formula and is priced in DAism's uToken. The unit of a price is vita.
3. uToken 可由 ETH 锻造获取，亦即定价通证有一个非常独特的发行机制，它也是后面要介绍的 IADD 网络核心要素。详见[《](https://shimo.im/docs/LKrkEVzDZNXUKAJp)[定价通证协议 (Unit Token Protocol)](https://shimo.im/docs/LKrkEVzDZNXUKAJp)[》](https://shimo.im/docs/LKrkEVzDZNXUKAJp)\
   uToken's issurance mechnism is unique and more details about it is presented in "[《](https://shimo.im/docs/LKrkEVzDZNXUKAJp)[Unit Token Protocol](https://shimo.im/docs/LKrkEVzDZNXUKAJp)[》](https://shimo.im/docs/LKrkEVzDZNXUKAJp)".
4. vita是基本价格单位。\
   定价通证 uToken 是道易程的去中心化交易和支付网络（IADD网络）中的定价标准物，它的基本价格单位为vita。那么也就是说，凡涉及到ERC-20代币交易或者支付时，一律以 vita为价格单位来标价。就支付来说，道易程生态里的一切产品和服务的售价，也都以 vita为价格单位来标价。如：\
   1 ISM = 0.01 vita\
   产品售价：0.5 vita/ kg\
   服务费：200 vita/ 小时\
   Vita is the smallest unit.\
   Any token or crypto asset such as ETH, ERC-20 tokens etc in circulation in DAism is priced in uToken. And the unit of a price is vita.\
   Any payment for products or services in DAism's is priced in the unit token(vita). For instance:\
   1 ISM = 0.01 vita

The price of a product: 0.5 vita/kg

The price for a service: 200 vita/hr

&#x20;

定价通证 uToken是道易程独创的币价标准物。它会最大程度地降低代币应用的复杂度，也完全符合去中心化市场的需要。\
The Unit Token is specifically created for DAism. It will minimize applications' complexity and frictions. It is what a real decentralized market needs.

&#x20;

**去中心化支付协议**

* 如果一家DAO发行了流通通证（即代币），则它出售产品或服务（其价格单位必须是 vita）时，付费者支付的其它代币均通过 IADD 网络转为该DAO自己发行的代币，再支付给该DAO的去中心化自治基金会。
* 如果该DAO没有发行代币，则它收费时直接收取 uToken。

&#x20;

**图片链上存储标准 A Standard for Saving Images Onchain**

我们原创的图片链上存储标准意义重大：

Our proposed standard for saving images onchain has great significance

* 首先应用于荣誉通证的链上存储。我们成功制订了[EIP-2569](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2569)（Saving and Displaying Image Onchain for Universal Tokens）。

In order to better implement tokens of honor, we proposed an Ethereum standard EIP-2569(Saving and Displaying Image Onchain for Universal Tokens)

* 它为探索到其它格式图片的存储打下了基础。

This standard paves the way for exploring more possibilities of saving images onchain.

&#x20;

**荣誉通证协议（Token of Honor Protocol）**

荣誉的记录和表彰，是DAO发展的重要激励手段。它不是道易程的核心协议，而是道易程dApp市场里的一个dApp所采用的协议。

Crediting a member with honor and Rewarding a member based on his/her credited honor is an important means to incentivize the development of a DAO. This protocol is not a core protocol of DAism but a protocol that is better adopted by dApps in DAism.

&#x20;

荣誉通证的应用面是非常广泛的，包含：

* 区块链领域的荣誉勋章（Medal of Honor）、纪念币（Commemorative Token）、纪念章、徽章、证书等等
* 大多具有收藏价值——也就是说我们的荣誉通证是百分之百保存在链上的（包括图片）。

目标：

* 该协议定义荣誉通证的基础发行标准
* 该协议定义荣誉通证的交易接口

这是我们开发的简单的荣誉通证交易所的DEMO：

[https://1155.goh.cool/](https://1155.goh.cool)

[https://honor.goh.cool](https://honor.goh.cool/latest)

Tokens of honor can be applied in a variety of applications including:

* Issurance of medals of honor, commemorative tokens, crypto medals, crypto certificates etc.
* The cryptos based on the token of honor protocol are valuable as collectibles ---- their elements such as smart contracts, metadata, images, etc are 100 percent persistently and permenantly saved onchain.

Purposes to propose this protocol:

* to define a standard for issurance of a token of honor
* to define interfaces and attributes of a token of honor

Here are some DEMOs of trading exchanges of tokens of honor we made:

**DApp接口标准与协议 Standards and Protocols for DApp Interfaces**

DAO的应用层就是各种扩展应用（也就是DAO功能的封装和扩展，我们称之为“DApp”），以及可能的独立Dapp。

包含：

* 第三方DApp的拓展接口。
* 第三方DApp的协议（DDIP，DAism dAPP Improvement Protocol）
* EIP-2569 （SVG以太坊存储标准）

A DAO can be scaled and extended by creating various applications (i.e. wrapping and creating new functions and extentions, which we call "DApps") and independent Dapps.

They inclue:

* Interfaces and modules provided or developed by third-party DApps
* Protocols developed by third-party DApps
* EIP-2569: an onchain standard for saving token images on Ethereum.

&#x20;

**UI标准 UI Standard**

为便于第三方开发道易程应用层的DApp，我们未来还要提供UI标准。当然第三方贡献也行。

For the sake of third parties' development of modules and DApps, we will provide UI standards in the future. For sure third-party developed standards are welcome as well.
