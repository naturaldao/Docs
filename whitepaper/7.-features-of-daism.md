# 6. Features of DAism

The past 12 years of development of blockchain has shown the great revolution brought by blockchain's two core technologies : tokens and smart contracts. These two core technologies have made decentralization, censorship-resistance, trustlessness, permissionlessness and anonymity show significant changes, power and value. However the changes, power and value have only been verified and implemented in the blockchain layer rather than the application layer. A valuable application relies on effective and efficient governance. For a blockchain based ecosystem, our ultimate goal is to create functioning decentralized autonomous smart organisms. We are striving to move towards this goal and are dedicating our efforts to making it happen.
