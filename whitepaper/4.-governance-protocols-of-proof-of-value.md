# 4. Governance Protocols of Proof-of-Value

As mentioned earlier, within DAism's Proof-of-Value (PoV), there are seven major governance protocolsï¼š

* DAO Hardcore Protocol
* Decentralized Minting Protocol
* Protocol of Decentralized Autonomous Fundation
* Protocol of Valuation Token's Supply
* Protocol of Unit Token
* Protocol of Decentralized Exchange
* Protocol of Universal Payment

## **DAO's Hardcore Protocol**

* DAO's Hardcore Protocol defines the basic information for a DAO such as the Organism's ID, name in English, logo image(in SVG format, recommended file size less than 6k), description(it can be a slogan), date of establishment, team members(in ETH address, anonymous), contract address of dApp, proprietary valuation token etc.
* When setting up a DAO, the creator has the option to manually add some addresses to the DAO as its initial members. The maximum limit for addresses is 64.
* The protocol also includes rules for upgrading the DAO.

## **Decentralized Minting Protocol**

Minting is a type of interaction between contracts and is the most fundamental action between smart contracts. DAism adopts a minimalist decentralized authentication method for creating DAOs. The creation of a DAO begins with a Minting request from a smart contract at a specific contract address, and is unrelated to any other "popular" DID solutions. The Minting protocol can prove which smart contract a DAO originates from, and this smart contract can let everyone know its function or purpose. The mechanism is very simple and absolutely authentic and reliable. This is the only way to create a DAO, and it can also serve as the genesis evidence of the DAO, resolving the issue of the association between the true information about the smart contract that the intelligent entity and its issued tokens and products (such as DApps) are based on.

At the same time, there's a sub-protocol in this protocol, which is a **Smart Property Protocol**, meaning that the Minting operation announces that a specific smart contract or a dApp (a combination of certain smart contracts) has become a Public Good of Ethereum. We call a dApp as a Public Property, which is under the governance of DAism.

> SP0 v0.1
>
> Using a dApp to Mint a DAO implies that the dApp accepts the SP0 protocol as its sole protocol and acknowledges the anonymity of all its owners and managers (referred to as members of the DAO).
>
> 1. No Copyright\
>    Anonymity signifies that the dApp developed under it has dedicated entirely to the public domain, becoming a worldwide public good. Apart from enjoying rewards brought about by PoV consensus, it relinquishes all other rights, including any related and neighboring rights.
> 2. No Liability\
>    Anonymity implies that members of the DAO are not providing any form of guarantee for this dApp and its exclusive valuation token. They do not assume any joint liability.\
>    When using or calling this dApp, or investing in the DAO's exclusive valuation tokens, you should not imply endorsement by the DAO or any member of this DAO.

## Protocol of Decentralized Autonomous Fundation <a href="#protocol-of-decentralized-autonomous-fundation" id="protocol-of-decentralized-autonomous-fundation"></a>

The Proof-of-Value (PoV) consensus of DAism provides rewards for every valuable DAO. Each DAO also has a minimalist Decentralized Autonomous Foundation (DAF), which can adjust the distribution of rewards. This includes determining the respective percentages allocated to each account.

## Protocol of Valuation Token's Supply**(Hayek Convention No.1)** <a href="#circulation-token-protocol" id="circulation-token-protocol"></a>

Any DAO can issue its exclusive valuation token. The primary function of valuation token is to engage investors in the assessment of the value of dApps and provide incentives for the consensus proof-of-value.

This procotol defines valuation token's name, symbol, logo, supply, price, etc.

This procotol is one of the key protocols of the IADD network. Every DAO that issues a valuation token follows the rules below:

* Token Standard adopted: [EIP-3712](https://github.com/naturaldao/EIPs/blob/Eip-Branch/EIPS/eip-3712.md) (developed by DAism's core team).
* All the supply should be directly issued to the liquidity of IADD network. The DAO that issues its valuation token has no reserves. This is a specially designed rule that prevents the DAO from colluding with "whales" to manipulate the market. Therefore, this protocol fundamentally revolutionizes the longstanding irrational token market supply in the blockchain markets.
* Uniform issuance: Total supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens, with an issuance price of 0.000000000000000000 vita.
* For every exchange of valuation token, a exchange fee (0.195%) is charged. And it will be directly rewarded to the DAO.

## **Protocol of Unit Token(Hayek Convention No.2)** <a href="#unit-token-protocol" id="unit-token-protocol"></a>

The unit token(Abbreviated as uToken) is a native token forged through Ether(ETH). In DAism's IADD Network (Decentralized Exchange and Decentralized Payment 2-in-1 network), it utilizes a constant product formula to price all valuation tokens.

This is a core innovation of DAism.

1. uToken is forged through ETH, meaning the pricing token has a unique issuance mechanism. It can be understood as a variant of ETH, deriving its value from the Ethereum. uToken is also a core element of the IADD Network, as further explained in the "Issuance of uToken: Forging with ETH" section in the "IADD Network" segment.
2. uToken is a highly unique token. It is defined by DAism as a price prototype, where 1 uToken is equal to 1 vita. Similar to the unit of mass in the well-known International System of Units, DAism has a set of price units for calculating the prices of valuation tokens, with vita serving as the fundamental unit of token prices.
3. In DAism every token is priced based on the algorithm CPMM (constant product market maker, or constant product formula) and is priced with a base unit "vita".
4.  Vita is the base unit of any valuation token's price.\
    uToken serves as the price prototype in IADD Network. Its price is denominated in vita, which means that whenever there is a valuation token exchange or payment, the pricing is consistently denominated in vita as the fundamental unit. For payments within tokenomics, the prices of all products and services are also quoted in vita. For instance:\
    1 ISM = 0.01 vita

    The price of a product: 0.5 vita/kg

    The price for a service: 200 vita/hr

uToken is a groundbreaking pricing token in DAism's unique price system. It significantly reduces the complexity of valuation token applications and aligns seamlessly with the requirements of decentralized markets and decentralized payments.

## **Reputation Protocol** (Optional)

This is an optional protocol. This protocol is one of the most important components of a DAO's decision-making mechanism and one of the most important protocols of a reputation system (others include circulation tokens and tokens of honor). It is also a quantitative metric that works with tokens of honor to evaluate the contribution of a member to a DAO.

Tokens of honor are used as

* PoW: member's proof of work, and
* PoS: member's proof of staking. For instance, if Alice's reputation value is twice as much as Bob's, one Alice's vote will weigh twice as much as that of one Bob's vote.

Adoption of reputation in DAOs will lead to integration of blockchain's consensus in DAOs.

For any member of a DAO his/her reputation is his/her proof of work. Therefore in a DAO a member's reputation is an incentive to the member's contribution just like mining to a miner in Bitcoin. For instance, two members A and B both belong to a DAO. If member A's contribution is twice as much as that of member B's, member A's reputation value will be twice as much as that of member B's. A member's reputation value is also the member's stake in a DAO, which means for instance, if member A's reputation value is twice as much as that of member B's, member A's voting weight will be twice as much as that of member B's.

Reputation is likely applied this way: any member with a certain reputation value can submit a proposal for any issue such as applying for financial support for a task. If this proposal is passed by qualified members, an amount of fund in the decentralized autonomous fund (abbreviated as "DAF") will be reserved for that member . However in this stage the fund is only reserved for the member. Only after the member accomplishes the task and the final result passes a audit, will the fund be sent to the member. Essentially, a DAO's fund is completely managed by collective decison-making processes rather than by a group of privileged people(most likely founders or co-founders of that DAO).

Here is how fund is granted from DAF:

Submit a proposal -> Evaluate the proposal -> Reserve fund (if the proposal passed) -> Accomplish a task -> Evaluate the result -> Send fund (if the result passes an audit)

Features of token of honor:

1 it is a non-transferrable fungible token. This prevents collusion among multiple members.

2 Each DAO has its own reputation.

3 A DAO's decentralized foundation (DF) makes rules and decisions. And these rules and decisions are coded in smart contracts and executed by smart contracts when predefined conditions are triggered. For instance, smart contracts can increase or decrease the reputation value owned by an ETH address or can blacklist an ETH address. Another instance might be that when a DAO pays its circulation tokens to an address, that address will be rewarded with a certain amount of tokens of honor as well.

4 A DAO's decentralized foundation (DF) can inherit the reputation value and rules of anther DAO's DF. For instance, if an ETH address is a member of multiple DAOs, when this address votes for a proposal in a DAO, its reputation value will be accounted as the sum of all the reputation values that it holds in all the multiple DAOs in which it is a member.

5 An ETH address can reject an increase offered to its reputation value or freeze its reputation value. The former may mean that this address is willing to offer the increase in reputation value to the reputation value of another ETH address temporarily. The latter may mean this address gives up its voting power.

## Protocol of Decentralized Exchange and Decentralized Payment <a href="#protocol-of-dex-and-payment" id="protocol-of-dex-and-payment"></a>

* For every transaction of a circulation token, a transaction fee (0.2%) is charged, while 0.195% is charged by its DAO and 0.001% is charged by DAism.
* After a circulating token(for example, ABC) of a DAO issued , when this DAO sells products or services (the price unit must be vita), the other tokens paid by the customer will be transferred to the token(ABC) issued by the DAO through the IADD network , And then paid to the DAO's decentralized autonomous foundation.&#x20;
* If there's no token issued for a DAO, it will charge uToken directly .

## **EIP-2569: A Standard for Saving Images Onchain**

Our proposed standard for saving images onchain has great significance

* In order to better implement tokens of honor, we proposed an Ethereum standard [EIP-2569(Saving and Displaying Image Onchain for Universal Tokens)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2569)
* This standard paves the way for exploring more possibilities of saving images onchain.

## **Token of Honor Protocol**

Crediting a member with honor and Rewarding a member based on his/her credited honor is an important means to incentivize the development of a DAO. This protocol is not a core protocol of DAism but a protocol that is better adopted by dApps in DAism.

Tokens of honor can be applied in a variety of applications including:

* Issurance of medals of honor, commemorative tokens, crypto medals, crypto certificates etc.
* The cryptos based on the token of honor protocol are valuable as collectibles ---- their elements such as smart contracts, metadata, images, etc are 100 percent persistently and permenantly saved onchain.

Purposes to propose this protocol:

* to define a standard for issurance of a token of honor
* to define interfaces and attributes of a token of honor

Here are some DEMOs of trading exchanges of tokens of honor we made:

[https://honor.goh.cool](https://honor.goh.cool/latest)

## **Standards and Protocols for DApp Interfaces**

A DAO can be scaled and extended by creating various applications (i.e. wrapping and creating new functions and extentions, which we call "DApps") and independent Dapps.

They inclue:

* Interfaces and modules provided or developed by third-party DApps
* Protocols developed by third-party DApps
* EIP-2569: an onchain standard for saving token images on Ethereum.

## **UI Standard**

For the sake of third parties' development of modules and DApps, we will provide UI standards in the future. For sure third-party developed standards are welcome as well.
