# Preface

**DAism Whitepaper needs a big upgrade, and this work might be delayed for a long time. We suggest you to view our** [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@daismcore8822) **and** [**Gamma Docks**](https://gamma.app/public/DAism1-An-Exchange-Good-Tokenomics-Needs-cp0hifw89174aw1) **as an alternative way.**



**DAism** is a public governance layer of Tokenomics and DAOs' value system.&#x20;

DAism inherits the governance principles from Bitcoin's proof-of-work and Ethereum's proof-of-stake. The original governance consensus introduced by DAism is known as Proof of Value (PoV).

This means that DAism serves as a public governance layer that enables the proliferation of DAOs and dApps, fostering the flourishing growth of Tokenomics.&#x20;
